### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
